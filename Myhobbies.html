      <li>I also like to go shopping, but does it count as hobby? Idk, you choose.</li>
      <li>Riding horses is one of the best feelings ever, so yeah I love "riding horses" to be one of my hobbies</li>
      <li>take a long walks in woods and nature is not only good for our physical health but to our mental health as
         well.</li>
      <li>and ofc because these are my favorite hobbies but I dont usually do them, because I am a developer and
         graphic designer so who have the time to do all of this??</li>
